The Sumobot is an autonomous robot that pushes other robots off of a black arena, bordered off by white. It's default state is to spin around continuously until it detects an object using its three ultrasonic sensors. Once an object is detected, it changes into the "attack" state where through conditional states, determine whether to turn left or right, or push forward. It also has LDR sensors to ensure it stays within the arena by triggering a move back if the robot sees white. Made by Alisa Wu and Olivia Chan.
